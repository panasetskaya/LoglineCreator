    <string name="mc_info">Describe your Main Character (MC)</string>

    </string-array>
    <string name="mc_gender_eg">Is the MAIN CHARACTER described in the event by more than \"he\" or \"she\"?</string>
    <string name="mc_hint">Typically this includes the character\'s function or job, and some weakness
        and/or strength. Loglines only have character names if the names are already a part of popular culture.</string>


    <!-- major event fragment -->
    <string name="major_event_hint">Events are things that happen to the main character and motivate their actions.
        They\'re never anything the character does. Here we\'re looking for the story\'s main event or
        Inciting Incident/Call To Adventure. This typically happens in the first 10â€“20 minutes.</string>

    <string name="theme_i_want">I want to include a THEME or Character Arc. </string>
    <string name="theme_hint">Even if theme is important in most stories, it is not critical to a basic logline.
        And often theme is established further down the development process.
        Leave it out for now, or try something and change it later.
        \n\nStart your answer with \"to\", e.g. \"to become less selfish\", \"to find purpose\", \"to re-establish her self-esteem\".  </string>
    <string name="theme_info">What does the MC have to learn/overcome?</string>
    <string name="theme_eg">E.g. \"to become a better person\".</string>

    <!--  main action fragment-->
    <string name="main_action_header">Main action</string>
    <string name="action_hint">The main action or goal is \'what the story is about\' for the broad audience.
        It is that part of the story we can visualise when we hear the logline, and
        which (hopefully) makes us want to see the film or show episode. It is the
        objective the main character will pursue for most of the time.
        \n\nStart your answer with \"to\", e.g. \"to find his son and return him home\".  </string>
    <string name="main_action_info">What is the story\'s main ACTION/GOAL?</string>
    <string name="main_action_eg">E.g. ""to do the Main Action"</string>

    <!-- mid point fragment -->
    <string name="mid_point_hint">This event often happens just when the goal is within reach.
        It flips the character\'s fortune, and any gains now seem lost.
        But it may also be the motivation for the character\'s change in goal or approach.
        After the MPR, they often change their behaviour and start doing \'the right thing\'.</string>
    <string name="mid_point_hint_alternative">This is optional, in case you know what an MPR is.
        \n\nThis Event makes the character change their behaviour usually for the better in the 2nd half of the story.
        \n\nThis can be a change of approach, or a new goal entirely, E.g. \"to venture into the ocean to kill the shark\".
    </string>
    <string name="mid_point_i_want">I want to include an MPR (Mid Point Reversal)</string>
    <string name="mid_point_header">Mid Point Reversal</string>
    <string name="mid_point_eg">E.g. \"something happens that changes everything,\"</string>
    <string name="mid_point_info">"What is the MPR EVENT? "</string>
    <string name="mid_point_after_info">"What does the MC do/pursue after the MPR Event? "</string>
    <string name="mid_point_after_eg">E.g. \"to take a New Approach\"</string>


    <!-- world fragment -->
    <string name="world_hint">Only add this if it is essential to understand the story.</string>

    <!-- deadline fragment -->
    <string name="deadline_hint">To make the logline work, write this as a full sentence like in the examples.
        \n\nOften the stakes are clear from the Main Event. But in some cases, adding negative
        stakes adds urgency to the logline, ultimately improving its emotional impact.</string>
